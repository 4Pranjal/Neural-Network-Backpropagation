## Introduction
Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure and function. Backpropagation is a popular algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting weights and biases to minimize the prediction error during training.

This repository provides an example of a neural network implementation using the backpropagation algorithm. The network is trained on a toy dataset, and it can be used for prediction tasks.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/neural-network-backpropagation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd neural-network-backpropagation
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```sh
   python backpropagation.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python (3.x)
- NumPy
- matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## Getting Started
1. Define Your Dataset: Modify the `dataset` array in the `backpropagation.py` script to match your dataset. Ensure that input features are represented in the first columns and output targets in the last column.

2. Adjust Hyperparameters: You can customize hyperparameters such as the number of hidden neurons, learning rate, and epochs according to your needs.

3. Training and Prediction: The script demonstrates training the neural network using the `Backpropagation` class and making predictions on new data points. You can modify the `new_data` array for prediction.
