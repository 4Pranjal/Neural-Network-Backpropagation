This code demonstrates the implementation of a simple feedforward neural network using backpropagation for training and prediction. The network architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
    - `numpy` is imported to perform mathematical operations.
    
2. **Sigmoid Activation Function**:
    - The `sigmoid` function is defined to compute the sigmoid activation of a given value.
    - The `sigmoid_derivative` function is defined to calculate the derivative of the sigmoid function.

3. **Backpropagation Class**:
    - The `Backpropagation` class is defined to implement the neural network.
    - In the constructor (`__init__`), the network's architecture is defined, and initial weights and biases are initialized.
    
4. **Forward Propagation**:
    - The `forward` method implements forward propagation through the network, computing activations of hidden and output layers using sigmoid activation function.

5. **Backward Propagation**:
    - The `backward` method implements backward propagation to update weights and biases based on calculated errors.
    
6. **Training**:
    - The `train` method trains the network using forward and backward propagation for a specified number of epochs and learning rate.
    
7. **Prediction**:
    - The `predict` method predicts the output for new input data using the trained network.
    
8. **Dataset Definition**:
    - A toy dataset (`dataset`) is defined, where each row represents input features and the last column represents the output target.
    
9. **Dataset Splitting**:
    - The dataset is split into input data (`X`) and output data (`y`).
    
10. **Instantiate the Neural Network**:
    - The `Backpropagation` class is instantiated with the specified input size, hidden size, and output size.
    
11. **Training**:
    - The instantiated neural network is trained using the `train` method with the defined number of epochs and learning rate.
    
12. **New Data for Prediction**:
    - A new data point (`new_data`) is prepared for prediction.
    
13. **Prediction**:
    - The trained neural network predicts the output for the new data using the `predict` method.
    
14. **Print Prediction**:
    - The predicted output is printed to the console.

Overall, this code demonstrates the process of creating a simple neural network using backpropagation to train on a dataset and make predictions on new input data. Note that this example uses a simplified dataset and architecture; real-world scenarios often involve more complex networks and larger datasets.
